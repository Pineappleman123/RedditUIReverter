# RedditUIReverter
Chrome extension to revert reddit ui back to the good 2nd gen interface
### How it works
- the script will redirect the reddit url to messages(which is one of the only known workarounds to the bad UI)
- then it will wait for the page to load, and it will redirect back to the home page, keeping the UI in place
### How to install
- download the redditchromeextension folder
- go to chrome://extensions
- in the top right corner, toggle developer mode to ON
- in the top left corner, click load unpacked extension
- a file selection menu will appear, select the downloaded redditchromeextension folder
- toggle the extension on, if it is not already on
- Enjoy!!!
